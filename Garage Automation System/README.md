# 🚗 Garage Automation System Designed Entirely with Logic Gates

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a fully combinational and sequential logic–based garage management system built entirely using fundamental logic gates (no microcontrollers).

The design demonstrates strong expertise in:

- Digital Electronics  
- Boolean Algebra  
- Finite State Machines (FSM)  
- Timing and Control Logic  
- Hardware-Level System Architecture  

The system is currently in the design and simulation phase, with planned implementation on real hardware using discrete components and/or FPGA.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Dual-gate control system (Entry & Exit)  
- Automated vehicle flow management  
- Integrated billing logic based on vehicle presence and timing  
- Anti-breach protection with alarm-triggering mechanisms  
- Collision-prevention logic to avoid illegal or unsafe passage  
- Scalable and flexible architecture adaptable to any two-gate garage layout

## 🔐 System Capabilities

The system ensures:

- Organized vehicle movement  
- Automated fee calculation  
- Security enforcement with minimal human intervention  

Special attention was given to edge cases, including:

- Unauthorized access attempts  
- Improper sequencing  
- Simultaneous gate events  

The architecture is modular and not limited to a specific physical layout. It can be adapted to various garage structures operating with two access points.
